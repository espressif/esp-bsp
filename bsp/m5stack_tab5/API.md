## Overview

This document provides an overview of the ESP-BSP (Board Support Package) API as implemented by this board.

While the ESP-BSP framework defines a unified API shared across multiple boards, this documentation focuses only on the APIs supported by the current board. Any APIs not applicable to this board's hardware are excluded or may not be functional.

The goal of this document is to make it easier for developers to understand the available APIs and how to use them consistently across different boards.

## General

### Pinout

Each BSP defines a set of macros for default pin assignments used by its hardware peripherals.
These macros allow users to configure or reference standard interfaces like I2C, SPI, LCD, audio, or SD cards easily.

- I2C: `BSP_I2C_*`
- Display: `BSP_LCD_*`
- Audio I2S: `BSP_I2S_*`
- USB: `BSP_USB_*`
- SD Card (MMC): `BSP_SD_*`
- SD Card (SPI): `BSP_SD_SPI_*`

> [!NOTE]
> Not all boards support all interfaces. You should always check if the related capability macro (e.g., BSP_CAPS_SDCARD) is defined.

### I2C

Some devices included in BSPs (e.g., sensors, displays, audio codecs) communicate via the I2C interface. In many cases, I2C is initialized automatically as part of the device setup. However, you can manually initialize or deinitialize the I2C peripheral using the following API:

```
/* Initialize the default I2C bus used by the BSP */
bsp_i2c_init();

...

/* Deinitialize the I2C bus */
bsp_i2c_deinit();
```

If you need direct access to the initialized I2C bus (e.g., to communicate with an external peripheral not handled by the BSP), you can retrieve the I2C bus handle:

```
i2c_master_bus_handle_t i2c = bsp_i2c_get_handle();
```

> [!NOTE]
> The BSP ensures that I2C initialization is performed only once, even if called multiple times. This helps avoid conflicts when multiple components rely on the same I2C bus.


### ADC

Some devices included in BSPs (such as buttons, battery monitoring, etc.) use the ADC peripheral. In most cases, the ADC is automatically initialized as part of the specific device setup. However, you can manually initialize the ADC using the following API:

```
/* Initialize the ADC peripheral */
bsp_adc_initialize();
```

If you need direct access to the ADC instance (e.g., for custom measurements), you can retrieve the handle:

```
adc_oneshot_unit_handle_t adc = bsp_adc_get_handle();
```

> [!NOTE]
> The BSP ensures the ADC is initialized only once, even if `bsp_adc_initialize()` is called multiple times.

### Features

Some boards support enabling or disabling specific hardware features (such as LCD, SD card, camera, etc.) to reduce power consumption or manage shared resources. The BSP provides a unified API to control these features:

```
/* Enable the LCD feature */
bsp_feature_enable(BSP_FEATURE_LCD, true);

/* Disable the speaker to reduce power usage */
bsp_feature_enable(BSP_FEATURE_SPEAKER, false);
```

Supported feature flags (may vary depending on the board):
- `BSP_FEATURE_LCD` - Display module
- `BSP_FEATURE_TOUCH` - Touch controller
- `BSP_FEATURE_SD` - SD card interface
- `BSP_FEATURE_SPEAKER`-  Audio speaker
- `BSP_FEATURE_BATTERY` - Battery monitoring
- `BSP_FEATURE_VIBRATION` - Vibration motor

> [!NOTE]
> Not all BSPs support feature toggling, and some features may not be available or controllable via this API. Always check the BSP header or documentation for supported features.

> [!TIP]
> Disabling unused features can help reduce power consumption, especially in battery-powered applications.
