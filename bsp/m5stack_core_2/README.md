M5Core2 is the second generation core device in the M5Stack development kit series, which further enhances the functions of the original generation of cores. It is a powerful and user-friendly development board with the following features:

- **MCU**: Equipped with an ESP32-D0WDQ6-V3, featuring dual core XtensaÂ® 32-bit 240Mhz LX6 processors that can be controlled separately.
- **Memory**: Onboard 16MB Flash and 8MB PSRAM.
- **Interface**: USB TYPE-C interface for charging, program downloading, and serial communication.
- **Display**: 2.0-inch integrated capacitive touch screen with three programmable capacitive buttons on the front.
- **Power Management:** Managed by an AXP192 power management chip (upgraded to AXP2101 in Core2 V1.1), which effectively controls power consumption. It includes a built-in green LED power indicator for battery level notification. The battery capacity is 390mAh, providing longer power duration than the previous model.
- **Audio**: I2S digital audio interface power amplifier chip to prevent signal distortion, along with a built-in speaker.
- **Expansion**: Retains a TF-card (microSD) slot, and an expansion board on the back with a 6-axis IMU sensor and a microphone.
- **RTC Module**: Built-in RTC module for accurate timing, with a dedicated battery for RTC power supply in Core2 V1.1.
Additional Features: Built-in vibration motor for haptic feedback, independent power, and reset buttons on the left side and bottom of the base.

#### Core2 V1.1 Enhancements
Core2 V1.1 is an iterative version of Core2 with the following upgrades and additional features:

- **Power Management**: Uses the AXP2101 power management chip for enhanced power control.
- **Indicators**: Built-in blue power indicator light for specific functions or status indications.
- RTC Battery: Dedicated battery for RTC power supply for accurate timing.
- **User Interaction**: Enhanced touch screen experience with programmable virtual buttons for diverse human-machine interaction.
