## LCD and TOUCH drivers

The BSP repository includes lot of LCD and Touch driver components. The list of available and planned LCDs is [here](LCD.md).

## How to use

### Examples

Best way to start with ESP-BSP is trying one of the [examples](examples) on your board. Every example contains `README.md` with a list of supported boards. Here is the summary of the available examples:

| Example | Supported boards |
|---|---|
| [display](examples/display) | WROVER-KIT |
| [display_audio](examples/display_audio) | Kaluga-kit |
| [display_camera](examples/display_camera) | Kaluga-kit |
| [display_audio_photo](examples/display_audio_photo) | ESP-BOX |
| [display_rotation](examples/display_rotation) | ESP-BOX |
| [display_lvgl_demos](examples/display_lvgl_demos) | ESP32-S3-LCD-EV-BOARD |
| [mqtt_example](examples/mqtt_example) | Azure-IoT-kit |
| [rainmaker_example](examples/rainmaker_example) | Azure-IoT-kit |
| [sensors_example](examples/sensors_example) | Azure-IoT-kit |

### BSP headers
Each BSP provides its header file in 'bsp' subfolder, so it can be included as follows: `#include "bsp/name-of-the-bsp.h"`.

For you convenience, each BSP also provides a wrapper header, which has the same name for all BSPs: `#include "bsp/esp-bsp.h"`.

> **_NOTE:_** There can be only one BSP in a single esp-idf project.

### In a custom project
Packages from this repository are uploaded to the [IDF component registry](https://components.espressif.com/).
You can add them to your project via `idf.py add-dependency`, e.g.
```
    idf.py add-dependency esp_wrover_kit==1.0.0
```

Alternatively, you can create `idf_component.yml` file manually, such as in [this example](examples/display/main/idf_component.yml).

### Recommendation for custom projects

When you want to use a BSP in a real project, it is highly recommended to disable configuration option `CONFIG_BSP_ERROR_CHECK` in menuconfig. You should check all returned error codes from all BSP functions you call. Otherwise, if the option `CONFIG_BSP_ERROR_CHECK` is enabled, any error encountered in a BSP will abort the program.

## Migration to ESP-IDF v5.0
ESP-IDF v5.0 brings a lot of new features, but, as the bump in major version suggests, also a lot of breaking changes.

ESP-BSP is kept up-to-date with the latest ESP-IDF version, but some breaking changes in ESP-BSP API are inevitable.
Usually, BSPs compatible with IDF v5.0 are version 2. If you want to use BSP with IDF v4.4 you can still use version 1 of the particular BSP.

More information about ESP-IDF breaking changes can be found in the [official migration guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/migration-guides/release-5.x/index.html).

## Additional information
More information about idf-component-manager can be found in [Espressif API guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/tools/idf-component-manager.html)
or [PyPi registry](https://pypi.org/project/idf-component-manager/).
