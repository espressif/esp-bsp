## LCD and TOUCH drivers

The BSP repository includes lot of LCD and Touch driver components. The list of available and planned LCDs is [here](LCD.md).

## How to use

### Examples

Best way to start with ESP-BSP is trying one of the [examples](examples) on your board. Every example contains `README.md` with a list of supported boards. Here is the summary of the available examples:

| Example | Supported boards |
|---|---|
| [audio](examples/audio) | ESP32-S3-Korvo-2 |
| [display](examples/display) | WROVER-KIT |
| [display_audio](examples/display_audio) | Kaluga-kit |
| [display_camera](examples/display_camera) | Kaluga-kit |
| [display_audio_photo](examples/display_audio_photo) | ESP-BOX |
| [display_rotation](examples/display_rotation) | ESP-BOX |
| [display_lvgl_demos](examples/display_lvgl_demos) | ESP32-S3-LCD-EV-BOARD |
| [touchscreen_colorwheel](examples/touchscreen_colorwheel) | ESP-BOX |
| [mqtt_example](examples/mqtt_example) | Azure-IoT-kit |
| [sensors_example](examples/sensors_example) | Azure-IoT-kit |

### BSP headers
Each BSP provides its header file in 'bsp' subfolder, so it can be included as follows: `#include "bsp/name-of-the-bsp.h"`. 
For you convenience, each BSP also provides a wrapper header, which has the same name for all BSPs: `#include "bsp/esp-bsp.h"`.

BSPs that contain LCD screen or touchscreen also provide `bsp/display.h` and `bsp/touch.h`. These files provide functions for LCD or touchscreen initialization without LVGL graphics library, which is used by default.

> **_NOTE:_** There can be only one BSP in a single esp-idf project.

### In a custom project
Packages from this repository are uploaded to the [IDF component registry](https://components.espressif.com/).
You can add them to your project via `idf.py add-dependency`, e.g.
```
    idf.py add-dependency esp_wrover_kit==1.0.0
```

Alternatively, you can create `idf_component.yml` file manually, such as in [this example](examples/display/main/idf_component.yml).

### Recommendation for custom projects

When you want to use a BSP in a real project, it is highly recommended to disable configuration option `CONFIG_BSP_ERROR_CHECK` in menuconfig. You should check all returned error codes from all BSP functions you call. Otherwise, if the option `CONFIG_BSP_ERROR_CHECK` is enabled, any error encountered in a BSP will abort the program.

## Migration to ESP-IDF v5.0
ESP-IDF v5.0 brings a lot of new features, but, as the bump in major version suggests, also a lot of breaking changes.

ESP-BSP is kept up-to-date with the latest ESP-IDF version, but some breaking changes in ESP-BSP API are inevitable.
Usually, BSPs compatible with IDF v5.0 are version 2. If you want to use BSP with IDF v4.4 you can still use version 1 of the particular BSP.
If you are interested in BSP examples for IDF v4.4, you can git checkout tag `examples_v4.4`.

More information about ESP-IDF breaking changes can be found in the [official migration guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/migration-guides/release-5.x/index.html).

### Compiling project for multiple BSPs

> :warning: **Experimental feature**: This feature is under development!

A single project can be run on multiple different development boards, if the boards contain the features required by the project (such as audio, display, camera...).
For this purpose, `idf.py` is extended by [examples/bsp_ext.py](examples/bsp_ext.py) which allows you to build an example for your specific BSP. Example command for [display](examples/display) e.g.:
```
idf.py -D SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.bsp.esp_wrover_kit build
```

In case you want to build locally for multiple boards at the same time, it is useful to have separate build directories for each BSP configuration.
In order to achieve this, you can extend the above command like this:
```
idf.py -B build/wrover_kit -D SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.bsp.esp_wrover_kit build
```
> Note: This feature is not yet integrated to idf.py by default. If you want to use it, you must set your environmental variable `IDF_EXTRA_ACTIONS_PATH` to path to `esp-bsp/examples/bsp_ext.py`.

## Additional information
More information about idf-component-manager can be found in [Espressif API guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/tools/idf-component-manager.html)
or [PyPi registry](https://pypi.org/project/idf-component-manager/).
